This is a simple scam notifier if you're unsure about a text. Input the number or text, and the app will check for keywords to determine if it's dangerous. I am tired of people being a victim to 
scams. In future updates I will:
- Use an algorithm and machine learning to detect more sophisticated scams.
- Add an API to detect malware and give a warning.
- Add a way to sideload and add to your device via an .ipa with enough interest.
